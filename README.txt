Hello!

This is my github page for COMP 271, or Data Structures 1.  Here you will find all of the assignments
fronm the class, as well as progress made from assignment to assignment. I've organized it in class
weeks, but most assignments were multiweek assignments.

In this course, we discussed arrays, linked lists, dynamic arrays, binary trees, nodes, efficient
database structures, and other things.  Hopefully, my code shows that.

For anyone coming accross this from Loyola, this class was taken fall 2023, so the assignments
may be different, but they do follow the same structure and processes.

Have a great day!
